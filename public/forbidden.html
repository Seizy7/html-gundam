        <h3>Technical and Historical Notes</h3>

            <p class="data">Despite the theft of four prototype Gundams by ZAFT, the Earth Alliance continued its research and constructed new units featuring advanced technologies. One such unit was the GAT-X252 Forbidden Gundam, which was designed as a close combat attack unit. One of the new technologies implemented in the Forbidden Gundam was Trans-Phase armor, an improved version of Phase Shift armor. Whereas Phase Shift armor utilized a “power up” mode denoted by color and a “power down” mode denoted by gray, Trans-Phase armor was designed to only activate at the point of impact and thus preserve energy. This energy could then be used for power-consuming energy weapons. As a close combat suit, the Forbidden Gundam was equipped with various beam and melee weaponry. Most notably, its large backpack could be fitted over its head for a high mobility close combat mode. In this close combat mode, it was capable of firing arcing beams from its “Hresvelgr” plasma cannon or standard shots from its twin “Eckzahn” railguns. The close combat mode also featured the “Geschmeidig Panzer” armor system, which could deflect and redirect beams. The system used a colloid gas filled with beam-deflecting particles, which were held in place by the magnetic charge generated by the shields. Other armaments included standard “Igelstellung” head vulcans and an “Armfeuer” machine gun. For melee combat, the Forbidden Gundam was equipped with a “Nidhoggr” heavy scythe for use outside of close combat mode.

            To keep up with the abilities of Coordinators, pilot Shani Andras was an Extended who had been subjected to brainwashing and the use of performance enhancing drugs. Unfortunately, these drugs had severe side effects after wearing off. The Forbidden Gundam was first deployed in combat during the Earth Alliance’s attack on the Orb Union. In Shani’s reckless hands, the Forbidden Gundam proved to be a challenging foe, even for Kira Yamato’s ZGMF-X10A Freedom Gundam. Following the defeat of Orb, the Forbidden Gundam was taken to space and transferred to the battleship Dominion under the supervision of Blue Cosmos leader Multa Azrael. The Forbidden Gundam was destroyed near the war’s end on September 26, C.E. 71, by Yzak Joule’s GAT-X102 Duel Gundam. The Forbidden Gundam’s design inspired the underwater variant GAT-X255 Forbidden Blue and its mass production counterpart, the GAT-706S Deep Forbidden.</p>
