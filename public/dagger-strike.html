        <h3>Technical and Historical Notes</h3>

            <p class="data">With ZAFT having pioneered mobile suit development through the introduction of the ZGMF-1017 GINN, the Earth Alliance was forced to quickly catch up and develop mobile suits to replace the ineffective mobile armor TS-MA2 Moebius. The end result of that effort was the GAT-01 Strike Dagger, a mass production mobile suit based on the GAT-X105 Strike Gundam. As a mass production suit, the Strike Dagger lacked many design elements present in the original Strike Gundam, such as the ability to mount Striker mission packs. It was armed with only one head vulcan, one beam saber and a beam rifle. The Strike Dagger also lacked EMP (electromagnetic pulse) shielding, which proved fatal in its debut at the Battle of Panama when ZAFT deployed its Gungnir System. These shortcomings were corrected later on with the GAT-01A1 Dagger. In terms of performance, the Strike Dagger generally exceeded the aging GINN in combat. The Alliance quickly produced a high number of Strike Daggers and sent them immediately to the front lines. Strike Daggers were used heavily during the assault on the Orb Union and later in space against ZAFT during the last battles of the war. Following the war, the Alliance produced an upgraded successor, the GAT-02L2 Dagger L.</p>
