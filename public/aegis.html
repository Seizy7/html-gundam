        <h3>Technical and Historical Notes</h3>

            <p class="data">
                With the outbreak of the Bloody Valentine War, the Earth Alliance’s Atlantic Federation began a secret project to develop mobile suits to counter ZAFT’s mass produced ZGMF-1017 GINN as well as operate free of interference from the N-Jammers. The GAT-X303 Aegis Gundam was one of five initial designs that the Alliance secretly constructed with Orb. Unlike the other four Gundams, the Aegis Gundam was constructed with a different frame and could transform into a mobile armor mode. The Aegis Gundam was also equipped with the new Phase Shift (PS) armor system. When using Phase Shift mode, the Aegis Gundam was nearly impervious to attacks from shell-firing artillery or melee weapons. However, use of Phase Shift for extended periods of time was a massive drain on the battery. In mobile suit mode, the Aegis Gundam’s armament consisted of head-mounted “Igelstellung” vulcan guns, four beam sabers and a beam rifle. However, in mobile armor mode it could use the powerful “Scylla” 580mm energy cannon. This powerful cannon was capable of destroying <a href="./moebius.html"> TS-MA2 Moebius</a> units with one shot, and it could severely damage battleships as well.

                The Aegis Gundam first entered combat on January 25, C.E. 71, when it was stolen by ZAFT pilot Athrun Zala during the attack on Heliopolis. Athrun was shocked to meet his old friend Kira Yamato and see him end up as the pilot the <a href="./strike.html">GAT-X105 Strike Gundam</a> on the battleship Archangel. Though Athrun continued to fight against the Archangel, he always did so reluctantly and offered Kira several opportunities to join ZAFT. When Kira refused, Athrun vowed no mercy for his former friend. As the Archangel continued to travel across Earth towards Alliance headquarters in Alaska, Athrun was sent down to Earth by Rau Le Creuset to pursue the ship. In a fierce battle on April 17, the Aegis Gundam was destroyed when Athrun self-destructed the suit in a failed attempt to kill Kira. Afterward, Athrun upgraded to the ZGMF-X09A Justice Gundam to pursue Kira and the stolen ZGMF-X10A Freedom Gundam. After the war, the Alliance created an upgraded version, the GAT-X303AA Rosso Aegis Gundam.</p>
