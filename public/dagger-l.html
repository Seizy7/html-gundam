        <h3>Technical and Historical Notes</h3>

            <p class="data">During the Bloody Valentine War, the Earth Alliance created the <a href="./dagger-strike.html">GAT-01 Strike Dagger</a> and <a href="./dagger.html"> GAT-01A1 Dagger</a> to combat ZAFT’s mobile suits. In the postwar period, the GAT-02L2 Dagger L was introduced as the successor to the Strike Dagger and Dagger. The improved Dagger L had the ability to use Striker packs, which the Strike Dagger lacked. The Dagger L also had double the number of vulcan guns and beam sabers. Its main hand armament was a beam carbine, but it could also use a low-recoil cannon. In addition, two “Stiletto” anti-armor penetrators were stored in the hips. In late C.E. 73, the Dagger L functioned as the Alliance’s main mass production mobile suit until the Break the World incident, in which a group of extremist Coordinators dropped the remains of the Junius Seven PLANT onto Earth and caused heavy damage. Afterwards, the Dagger L series was slowly replaced with a new mass production model, the GAT-04 Windam.</p>
