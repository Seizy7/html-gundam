        <h3>Technical and Historical Notes</h3>

            <p class="data">Despite the theft of four prototype Gundams by ZAFT, the Earth Alliance continued its research and constructed new units featuring advanced technologies. One such unit was the GAT-X131 Calamity Gundam, which was designed as a long-range artillery unit similar to the stolen <a href="./buster.html">GAT-X103 Buster Gundam</a>. One of the new technologies implemented in the Calamity Gundam was Trans-Phase armor, an improved version of Phase Shift armor. Whereas Phase Shift armor utilized a “power up” mode denoted by color and a “power down” mode denoted by gray, Trans-Phase armor was designed to only activate at the point of impact and thus preserve energy. This energy could then be used for power-consuming energy weapons. As an artillery unit, the Calamity Gundam featured a variety of weapons. Its main weapon was the twin “Schlag” 125mm beam cannons mounted on the backpack. Other armaments included a “Scylla” beam cannon in the chest, which was identical to the one used by the  <a href="./aegis.html">GAT-X303 Aegis Gundam</a>. The Calamity Gundam also used a handheld “Todesblock” plasma bazooka, and its shield was equipped with a “Kaefer Zwei” ram cannon. Since the Calamity Gundam was designed for long-range combat, it didn’t come equipped with any close-range melee weapons.

            To keep up with the abilities of Coordinators, pilot Orga Sabnak was an Extended who had been subjected to brainwashing and the use of performance enhancing drugs. Unfortunately, these drugs had severe side effects after wearing off. The Calamity Gundam was first deployed in combat during the Earth Alliance’s attack on the Orb Union. Following the defeat of Orb, the Calamity Gundam was taken to space and transferred to the battleship Dominion under the supervision of Blue Cosmos leader Multa Azrael. The Calamity Gundam was destroyed near the war’s end on September 26, C.E. 71, by Athrun Zala’s ZGMF-X09A Justice Gundam. The Alliance also developed a close combat variant, the GAT-X133 Sword Calamity. </p>
