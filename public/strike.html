        <h3>Technical and Historical Notes</h3>

            <p class="data">With the outbreak of the Bloody Valentine War, the Earth Alliance’s Atlantic Federation began a secret project to develop mobile suits to counter ZAFT’s mass produced ZGMF-1017 GINN as well as operate free of interference from the N-Jammers. The GAT-X105 Strike Gundam was one of five initial prototype suits secretly developed in conjunction with Orb’s Morgenroete defense company. Whereas the other Gundams were designed for specific roles, the Strike Gundam was intended to operate in various configurations through the use of Striker packs. Like the other prototype Gundams, the Strike Gundam was equipped with the new Phase Shift (PS) armor technology. When using Phase Shift mode, the Strike Gundam was nearly impervious to attacks from shell-firing artillery or melee weapons. However, use of Phase Shift for extended periods of time was a massive drain on the battery. The basic version of the Strike Gundam was nearly identical to the GAT-X102 Duel Gundam‘s initial configuration. Its armament consisted of two “Igelstellung” vulcan guns, a 57mm beam rifle, a shield and two “Armor Schneider” combat knives. Other optional armaments included a bazooka designed for underwater combat. In addition to the first unit, Orb later constructed an improved version from spare parts, the MBF-02 Strike Rouge. The Alliance also constructed a third unit, which was later upgraded into the GAT-X105E Strike Gundam E. The Strike Gundam was later followed by the mass production GAT-01 Strike Dagger and GAT-01A1 Dagger.

            The first Strike Gundam entered combat in January 25, C.E. 71, when ZAFT attacked Orb’s space colony Heliopolis in an attempt to steal the Gundam prototypes. Although ZAFT succeeded in capturing four units, the Strike Gundam remained in Alliance control and was initially (and ineffectively) used by Murrue Ramius. However, young Coordinator Kira Yamato was able to modify the incomplete operating system and made the Strike Gundam combat ready. Following the destruction of Heliopolis, Kira became the Strike Gundam’s default pilot and joined the crew of the battleship Archangel. While heading for the Alliance’s Alaskan headquarters, the Strike Gundam was severely damaged in battle on April 17 by Athrun Zala’s self-destructing GAT-X303 Aegis Gundam. The Strike Gundam was later repaired by Orb and passed on to ace pilot Mu La Flaga, while Kira stole ZAFT’s new ZGMF-X10A Freedom Gundam. The Strike Gundam served as Mu’s personal mobile suit after the Archangel‘s crew defected from the Alliance and joined the Orb forces and Clyne faction to form the Three Ships Alliance. At the war’s end on September 27, the Strike Gundam was damaged in a duel with Rau Le Creuset’s ZGMF-X13A Providence Gundam and later destroyed while protecting the Archangel from an attack by the Alliance battleship Dominion. Two years after the war, the versatile design of the Strike Gundam served as the inspiration for ZAFT’s ZGMF-X56S Impulse Gundam.</p>
