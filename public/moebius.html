        <h3>Technical and Historical Notes</h3>

            <p class="data">The mass produced mobile armor TS-MA2 Moebius served as the backbone of the Earth Alliance’s military for most of the Bloody Valentine War. It was inexpensive to construct and could be outfitted with various types of weapons. The main armament of the Moebius included a linear gun and four missile launchers, all mounted beneath the main body. The Moebius could also be equipped with nuclear missiles, which were used to destroy the ZAFT PLANT Junius Seven on February 14, C.E. 70, in what was later known as the Bloody Valentine incident that ignited the war. Following the Bloody Valentine, ZAFT initiated Operation Uroboros and deployed Neutron Jammers (N-Jammers) in space and on Earth to disrupt all nuclear reactions. With the introduction of ZAFT’s first mobile suit, the ZGMF-1017 GINN, the Moebius quickly became the inferior unit and performed poorly in combat. To respond to the ineffectiveness of the Moebius type, the Alliance’s Atlantic Federation began a secret project to develop mobile suits more powerful than the GINN. The end result of this project was five prototype Gundam mobile suits. In late C.E. 71, the Alliance secretly acquired ZAFT’s N-Jammer Canceler technology, which nullified the N-Jammer’s abilities. With this new technology, the Alliance sent many Moebius units back to the front lines equipped with nuclear missiles to once again attack the PLANTs.</p>
