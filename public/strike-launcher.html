        <h3>Technical and Historical Notes</h3>

            <p class="data">The GAT-X105+AQM/E-X03 Launcher Strike Gundam was equipped for long-range combat similar to the GAT-X103 Buster Gundam. Its main weapon was the “Agni” 320mm impulse cannon, which was powerful enough to blast through a space colony’s wall. Additionally, the Launcher Strike Gundam was equipped with a combination weapons pod on its right shoulder, which included a 120mm anti-ship vulcan gun and 350mm gun launchers. The Launcher Striker was the first Striker pack to be used in battle by Kira Yamato and proved to be too powerful for inner colony battle when it damaged Heliopolis. Like the other Striker packs, the Launcher Striker could be docked with the <a href="./skygrasper.html">FX-550 Sky Grasper</a> support fighter.</p>
