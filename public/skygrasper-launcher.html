        <h3>Technical and Historical Notes</h3>

            <p class="data">The FX-550+AQM/E-X03 Launcher Grasper configuration mounted the GAT-X105 Strike Gundam‘s Launcher Striker pack. The Launcher Striker pack added considerable firepower to that of the Sky Grasper. Mounted underneath the left wing, the “Agni” hyper impulse cannon could take out mobile suits in a single shot. In addition, the combo weapons pod on the right wing could be used against ground or air targets.</p>
