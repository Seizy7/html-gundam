        <h3>Technical and Historical Notes</h3>

            <p class="data">The GAT-01A1+AQM/E-X04 Gunbarrel Dagger was a unit designed for ace pilots who had special spatial awareness. The AQM/E-X04 Gunbarrel Striker that docked with the GAT-01A1 Dagger featured wire-guided Gunbarrels similar to those used by the mobile armor TS-MA2Mod.00 Moebius Zero. Because the spatial awareness required to control the Gunbarrels was a rare ability, only pilots such as Morgan Chevalier and Mu La Flaga were capable of using them. One unit was used by Morgan during and after the Bloody Valentine War. Late in the war, Morgan dueled with Canard Pars’ CAT1-X1/3 Hyperion Gundam Unit 1 in lunar orbit. At the end of that battle, Morgan’s Gunbarrel Striker was destroyed. After the war, Morgan fought a former comrade, Edward Harrelson, who defected from the Earth Alliance.</p>
