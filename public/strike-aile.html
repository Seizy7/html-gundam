        <h3>Technical and Historical Notes</h3>

            <p class="data">Unlike the four other Gundam prototypes, the GAT-X105 Strike Gundam was intended to operate in many environments and various mission roles. The GAT-X105+AQM/E-X01 Aile Strike Gundam was designed specifically for flight and mobility. In space, the additional thrusters made the Strike Gundam more maneuverable. On Earth, the AQM/E-X01 Aile Striker pack allowed the Strike Gundam to make high jumps and fly briefly. Aside from the extra thrusters, the Aile Striker pack added two beam sabers to the Strike Gundam’s armaments. Additionally, the Aile Striker pack was capable of docking with the support fighter FX-550 Sky Grasper. Because of its extra mobility, the Aile Striker pack was the most widely used of the Striker packs in space and on Earth.</p>
