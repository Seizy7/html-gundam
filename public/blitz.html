        <h3>Technical and Historical Notes</h3>

            <p class="data">With the outbreak of the Bloody Valentine War, the Earth Alliance’s Atlantic Federation began a secret project to develop mobile suits to counter ZAFT’s mass-produced ZGMF-1017 GINN as well as operate free of interference from the N-Jammers. The GAT-X207 Blitz Gundam was one of five initial designs that the Alliance secretly built with Orb. The Blitz Gundam’s design was geared towards melee combat and stealth missions. Like the other prototype Gundams, the Blitz Gundam was equipped with the new Phase Shift (PS) armor technology. When using Phase Shift mode, the Blitz Gundam was nearly impervious to attacks from shell-firing artillery or melee weapons. However, use of Phase Shift for extended periods of time was a massive drain on the battery. Unlike the other four prototypes, the Blitz Gundam’s body was coated with Mirage Colloid particles. When activated, the Mirage Colloid rendered the Blitz Gundam invisible to the human eye as well as computer sensors for up to 80 minutes. However, the Mirage Colloid could not be used simultaneously with Phase Shift, which made the Blitz Gundam vulnerable to attacks while invisible. Its armament consisted of a “Trikeros” offensive/defensive system. Mounted on the right arm, this system functioned as a shield and beam rifle, and also shot out lancer darts. The Blitz Gundam was also equipped with a “Gleipnir” anchor on its left arm, which was similar to the “Panzer Eisen” rocket anchor used by the <a href="./strike-sword.html">GAT-X105+AQM/E-X02 Sword Strike Gundam</a>.

            The Blitz Gundam first entered combat on January 25, C.E. 71, when it was stolen by ZAFT pilot Nicol Amalfi during the attack on Heliopolis. Subsequently, Nicol tested the Mirage Colloid system by using it to penetrate the defenses of the supposedly impregnable Alliance space fortress Artemis. Nicol was later killed on Earth when his damaged Blitz Gundam was destroyed by Kira Yamato’s Strike Gundam. Orb noble Rondo Gina Sahaku later used a salvaged arm from the Blitz Gundam to upgrade his MBF-P01 Gundam Astray Gold Frame. After the war, the Alliance created the upgraded GAT-X207SR Nero Blitz Gundam, along with a special operations production unit, the GAT-S02R N Dagger N.</p>
