        <h3>Technical and Historical Notes</h3>

            <p class="data">The prototype mobile armor TS-MA2mod.00 Moebius Zero served as the basis for the Earth Alliance’s mass production <a href="./moebius.html">TS-MA2 Moebius</a>. It outperformed its mass production counterpart on various levels; aside from being more maneuverable, the Moebius Zero was also more heavily armed. It used the same standard linear gun as the Moebius, but its main weapon was four wire-guided gunbarrels. These gunbarrels could be detached and spread out to attack an enemy from multiple angles, but they could only be used by pilots with high spatial awareness. The Moebius Zero was used effectively throughout the war by ace pilot Mu La Flaga, who earned the nickname “Hawk of Endymion” by single-handedly destroying five ZGMF-1017 GINNs in battle on the Grimaldi Front. Mu’s piloting skills even allowed him to perform well against enemy ace pilot Rau Le Creuset’s ZGMF-515 CGUE.

            After joining the crew of the new battleship Archangel, Mu used his Moebius Zero to defend the ship with the help of Kira Yamato’s <a href="./strike.html">GAT-X105 Strike Gundam</a>. When the Archangel descended to Earth, Mu switched over to the new support fighter <a href="./skygrasper.html">FX-550 Sky Grasper</a> due to the Moebius Zero’s inability to fly in the atmosphere. The Alliance later took the design of the Moebius Zero and used it as the basis for the Striker pack AQM/E-X04 Gunbarrel. The Moebius Zero also served as the inspiration for a later unit, the TS-MA4F Exus.</p>
