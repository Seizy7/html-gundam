        <h3>Technical and Historical Notes</h3>
  
            <p class="data">With the outbreak of the Bloody Valentine War, the Earth Alliance’s Atlantic Federation began a secret project to develop mobile suits to counter ZAFT’s mass produced ZGMF-1017 GINN as well as operate free of interference from the N-Jammers. One of the first five prototype mobile suits was the GAT-X102 Duel Gundam, which served as a testbed for the <a href="./buster.html">GAT-X103 Buster Gundam</a>, <a href="./strike.html">GAT-X105 Strike Gundam</a> and <a href="./blitz.html">GAT-X207 Blitz Gundam</a>. As a basic mobile suit, the Duel Gundam was designed for close combat. Its armament consisted of two beam sabers, two “Igelstellung” vulcan guns and a combination high-energy beam rifle/grenade launcher. Like the other prototype Gundams, the Duel Gundam was equipped with the new Phase Shift (PS) armor technology. When in Phase Shift mode, the Duel Gundam was nearly impervious to attacks from shell-firing artillery or melee weapons. However, use of Phase Shift for extended periods of time was a massive drain on the battery.

            On January 25, C.E. 71, the Duel Gundam was stolen by ZAFT pilot Yzak Joule during ZAFT’s assault on the neutral Orb Union colony Heliopolis. Following the escape of the Earth Alliance battleship Archangel, Yzak and his Duel Gundam continued to harass the Archangel‘s crew during the later period of the war. During one battle with Kira Yamato’s Strike Gundam, the Duel Gundam was heavily damaged and Yzak’s face was scarred. Afterward, ZAFT upgraded the Duel Gundam to the Assault Shroud configuration. With this upgrade, extra armor plates were fitted over the main body, along with several new weapons. These weapons included a 5-barrel missile pod launcher on the left shoulder, as well as a 115mm “Shiva” railgun on the right shoulder. Although ZAFT developed the Assault Shroud upgrade themselves, the Earth Alliance copied and incorporated it into two limited production versions of the Duel Gundam: the GAT-01D Long Dagger and GAT-01D1 Duel Dagger. With his upgraded mobile suit, Yzak vowed to get revenge on Kira for the scar he received. However, at the war’s end on September 26, C.E. 71, Yzak assisted the Three Ships Alliance in defending the PLANTs. After the war, another Duel Gundam unit piloted by Mudie Holcroft was upgraded to the GAT-X1022 Blu Duel Gundam. By C.E. 75, the original Duel Gundam unit stolen by ZAFT was upgraded and redesignated as the ZGMF-1027M Duel Blitz Gundam.</p>
