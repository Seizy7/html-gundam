        <h3>Technical and Historical Notes</h3>

            <p class="data">During the Bloody Valentine War, the Alliance created the GAT-01A1 Dagger, a mass production version of the GAT-X105 Strike Gundam. Unlike the Alliance’s first mass production suit, the GAT-01 Strike Dagger, the Dagger series was compatible with the Strike Gundam’s Striker packs. The GAT-01A1+AQM/E-X03 Launcher Dagger was armed with the same hyper impulse cannon and combo weapon pod as the GAT-X105+AQM/E-X03 Launcher Strike Gundam. The Dagger remained in service as late as the Second Bloody Valentine War, and several units participated in the defense of the Alliance’s Heavens Base headquarters in Iceland during ZAFT’s Operation Ragnarok.</p>
