        <h3>Technical and Historical Notes</h3>

            <p class="data">Despite the theft of four prototype Gundams by ZAFT, the Earth Alliance continued its research and constructed new units featuring advanced technologies. One such unit was the GAT-X370 Raider Gundam, which was designed as a transforming mobile suit similar to the GAT-X303 Aegis Gundam. One of the new technologies implemented in the Raider Gundam was Trans-Phase armor, an improved version of Phase Shift armor. Whereas Phase Shift armor utilized a “power up” mode denoted by color and a “power down” mode denoted by gray, Trans-Phase armor was designed to only activate at the point of impact and thus preserve energy. This energy could then be diverted to power-consuming energy weapons. Like the Aegis Gundam, the Raider Gundam was equipped with weapons that were operable in its variable configurations. In mobile suit mode, the Raider Gundam featured a twin machine gun mounted on its right arm. It also featured a “Zorn” energy cannon in place of a mouth, which was operable in either configuration. For close combat, the Raider Gundam was also equipped with a “Mjolnir” hammer. While in flight mode, the Raider Gundam could utilize the “Ahura Mazda” cannons located on the claws, as well as several machine guns mounted on the nose and shoulders. The armaments featured in the Raider Gundam were a variation on the original design, the GAT-333 Raider Full Spec.

            To keep up with the abilities of Coordinators, pilot Clotho Buer was an Extended who had been subjected to brainwashing and the use of performance enhancing drugs. Unfortunately, these drugs had severe side effects after wearing off. The Raider Gundam was first deployed in combat during the Earth Alliance’s attack on the Orb Union. While on Earth, the Raider Gundam also served as a sub-flight unit for the GAT-X131 Calamity Gundam. Following the defeat of Orb, the Raider Gundam was taken to space and transferred to the battleship Dominion under the supervision of Blue Cosmos leader Multa Azrael. The Raider Gundam was destroyed near the war’s end on September 26, C.E. 71, by Yzak Joule’s GAT-X102 Duel Gundam.</p>
