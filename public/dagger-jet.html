        <h3>Technical and Historical Notes</h3>

            <p class="data">During the Bloody Valentine War, the Alliance created the GAT-01A1 Dagger, a mass production version of the GAT-X105 Strike Gundam. Unlike the Alliance’s first mass production suit, the GAT-01 Strike Dagger, the Dagger series was compatible with the Strike Gundam’s Striker packs. One such pack was the AQM/E-A4E1 Jet Striker, an atmospheric flight unit that was also compatible with the Dagger. The Jet Striker pack was armed with a variety of missile launchers and rocket pods. The original armaments of the Dagger remained the same, except that its hand-carried machine guns were replaced with the Dagger L’s beam carbine. The Dagger remained in service as late as the Second Bloody Valentine War, and several units participated in the defense of the Alliance’s Heavens Base headquarters in Iceland during ZAFT’s Operation Ragnarok.</p>
