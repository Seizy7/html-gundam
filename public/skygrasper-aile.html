        <h3>Technical and Historical Notes</h3>

            <p class="data">The FX-550+AQM/E-X01 Aile Grasper configuration mounted the <a href="./strike.html">GAT-X105 Strike Gundam‘s</a> Aile Striker pack. The Aile Striker pack added to the speed and mobility of the Sky Grasper. Although beam sabers were stored on the Aile pack, they could not be used by the Aile Grasper. However, the Strike Gundam’s beam rifle could be mounted on the right wing and used for added firepower.</p>
