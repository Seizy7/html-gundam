        <h3>Technical and Historical Notes</h3>

            <p class="data">The GAT-X105+AQM/E-X02 Sword Strike Gundam was designed with close combat in mind. Unlike the other configurations of the Strike Gundam, the Sword Strike Gundam featured no beam-firing weapons. The main armament of this configuration was the 15.78 meter-long “Schwert Gewehr” anti-ship sword. This long sword was capable of easily slicing apart a mobile suit or causing substantial damage to a battleship. A similar sword design was later utilized by the GAT-X133 Sword Calamity. The Sword Strike Gundam was also outfitted with a “Panzer Eisen” rocket anchor on its left forearm. The rocket anchor could be fired along a line and resembled the “Gleipnir” anchor used by the GAT-X207 Blitz Gundam. Additionally, the Sword Strike Gundam’s left shoulder housed a “Midas Messer” beam boomerang. As was the case with the other Striker packs, the Sword Striker pack could also dock with the FX-550 Sky Grasper support fighter.</p>
